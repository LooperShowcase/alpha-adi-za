      a fullscreen view Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ BAR-sə-LOH-nə, Catalan:
      [bəɾsəˈlonə], Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona]) is a city on the coast of
      northeastern Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous
      community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality
      of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its
      urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the
      Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making
      it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris,
      the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises
      on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the
      rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de
      Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680
      feet) high. Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became
      the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of
      Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which
      continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the
      most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and
      administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia,
      wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic
      union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492.
      Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural
      centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the
      architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which
      have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two
      of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona
      and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the
      Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the
      1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions
      and also many international sport tournaments. Barcelona is a major
      cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[8] as
      well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[9] As a leading world city,
      Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for
      global city status (Beta +).[10] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the
      Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest
      European passenger port,[11] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat
      Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year,[12] an
      extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to
      France and the rest of Europe.[13] Contents 1 Names 2 History 2.1

      Gerenal references 15 External links Names The name Barcelona comes from
      the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found
      on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as Barkeno in Levantine
      Iberian script,[14] in ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών,
      Barkinṓn;[15][16] and in Latin as Barcino,[17] Barcilonum[18] and
      Barcenona.[19][20][21] Some older sources suggest that the city may have
      been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed
      to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[22] but there is no
      evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its
      name in antiquity, Barcino, had any connection with the Barcid family of
      Hamilcar.[23] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as
      Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.
      Internationally,[citation needed] Barcelona's name is abbreviated
      colloquially to 'Barça' in reference to the football club FC Barcelona,
      whose anthem is the Cant del Barça "Barça chant". A common abbreviated
      form used by locals for the city is Barna. Another common abbreviation is
      'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat
      Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and
      Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., "Comital City" or "City of Counts"), owing
      to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[24] History Main
      article: History of Barcelona For a chronological guide, see Timeline of
      Barcelona. See also: Street names in Barcelona A marble plaque in the
      Museu d'Història de la Ciutat de Barcelona, dated from around 110–130 AD
      and dedicated to the Roman colony of Barcino Pre-history The origin of the
      earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The
      ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs
      and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[25][26] The founding of
      Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes
      the founding of the city to the mythological Hercules. The second legend
      attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical
      Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly
      named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[27] but
      there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.[23]
      Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd Century BC have
      been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno
      written in an ancient script in the Iberian language. Thus, we can
      conclude that the Laietani, an ancient Iberian (Pre-Roman) people of the
      Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of
      Barcelona around 3 – 2 BC, called the area Bàrkeno, which means "The Place
      of the Plains" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[28] Roman Barcelona In about 15
      BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred
      on the "Mons Taber", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan
      Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of
      the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where
      current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political center of the city,
      Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2000
      years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[29]
      or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[30] or Colonia
      Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[31] mentions it
      among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its
      neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later
      writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it
      was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[32] It enjoyed
      immunity from imperial burdens.[33] The city minted its own coins; some
      from the era of Galba survive. The Mare de Déu de la Mercè statue on the
      Basílica de la Mercè Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del
      Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA);
      the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the
      historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining
      fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the
      cathedral.[34] The cathedral, known very formally by the long name of
      Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La
      Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in
      Catalan.[35][36] It is said to have been founded in 343. Medieval
      Barcelona The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th
      century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being
      conquered by the Arabs in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a
      siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of
      the Carolingian "Hispanic March" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by
      the Count of Barcelona.[37] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly
      independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern
      Catalonia, although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of
      Almanzor.[38] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's
      population was either killed or enslaved.[39] In 1137, Aragon and the
      County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[40][41] by the marriage of
      Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by
      only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne
      in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon,
      which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western
      Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as
      far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade
      centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was
      eclipsed by Valencia.[42] It initially fed from eastern and balkan slave
      stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of
      slaves.[43] The Bank of Barcelona or Taula de canvi, often viewed as the
      oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in
      1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of
      Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[44] Barcelona in 1563
      Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy The marriage of Ferdinand II of
      Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the two royal lines.
      Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the
      Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of
      Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism,
      including the Catalan Revolt (1640–52) against Philip IV of Spain. The
      great plague of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.[45] The fortress
      at Montjuïc, the most southerly point from which measurements were made
      when calculating the meridional definition of the metre In the 18th
      century, a fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. In
      1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre François
      André Méchain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk
      that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.[46] The
      definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the
      French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was
      negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of
      industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve. The Spanish
      Civil War and the Franco period Barcelona was the capital of the Republic
      of Spain from November 1937 until January 1939.[47][48] During that
      Spanish Civil War period, both Barcelona and Madrid were still under the
      rule of the republic. In the image Azaña and Negrín on the city outskirts.
      During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were
      resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were
      collectivised by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican
      government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the
      effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the
      city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops,
      after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city
      on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the
      French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to
      have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The
      autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[49] and the use of
      the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the
      second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was
      relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the
      civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of
      Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to
      rapid urbanisation. Late twentieth century In 1992, Barcelona hosted the
      Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major
      changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As
      part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the
      sea-front were demolished and 3 kilometres (2 miles) of beach were
      created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%,
      the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and
      beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the
      city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city
      was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city
      destination in the world and the 5th amongst European
      cities.[50][51][52][53][54] Recent history Main articles: History of
      Barcelona and Timeline of Barcelona Supporters of Catalan independence in
      October 2019 Protest against independence in October 2017 The death of
      Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain.
      Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered
      that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its
      support of the Republican government.[55] Massive, but peaceful,
      demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the
      streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It
      was granted less than a month later.[56] The development of Barcelona was
      promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European
      Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the
      1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been
      rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of
      the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led
      to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades
      of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This
      decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration
      (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]
      In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August
      2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and
      injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place
      elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called
      the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed
      indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and
      the Levant (ISIL).[60][61][62] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the
      focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement,
      its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and
      later protests.[63] Geography A panoramic view of Barcelona Location
      Barcelona as seen by the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-2
      mission Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian
      Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3
      mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river
      to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[64] This plain covers
      an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[64] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[65] are
      occupied by the city itself. It is 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of the
      Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft)

      from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of
      them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon
      them, such as Carmel (267 metres or 876 feet), Putget (es) (181 metres or
      594 feet) and Rovira (261 metres or 856 feet). The escarpment of Montjuïc
      (173 metres or 568 feet), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour
      and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th
      centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today,
      the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and
      cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city
      borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià
      de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de
      Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de
      Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del
      Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two
      small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. Climate Main article:
      Climate of Barcelona According to the Köppen climate classification,
      Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters
      and warm to hot summers,[67] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and
      spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry
      season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical
      Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than
      February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype,
      labelled as "Portuguese" by the French geographer George Viers after the
      climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[68] and found in the NW
      Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the
      humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is
      densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island
      effect. Areas outside of the urbanised districts can have as much as 2 °C
      of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[69] Its average annual
      temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at
      night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F).
      In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to
      18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and
      the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[70] In the warmest month,
      August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F)
      during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea
      temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[70] Generally, the summer or "holiday"
      season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and
      November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68
      °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and
      11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the
      coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the
      day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare,
      particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm
      sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of
      Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but
      light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such
      as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[71] Barcelona
      averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative
      humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall
      totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and
      lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter
      minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from
      138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10
      hours of sunshine a day) in July.[72] Climate data for Barcelona Can

      (Barcelona–El Prat Airport) (1981-2010) at 15 kilometres (9.3 mi)) from
      the city centre of Barcelona. Demographics Demographic evolution,
      1900–2007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística
      According to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1
      January 2016 was 1,608,746 people,[75] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq
      mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater
      Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 square
      kilometres (246 square miles) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The
      population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus
      of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of
      5,474,482.[4] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according
      to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and
      it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken
      in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can
      speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[76] Knowledge of Catalan
      has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language
      immersion educational system. In 1900, Barcelona had a population of
      533,000,[64] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started
      absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of
      Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell
      throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of
      life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After
      bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population
      began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great
      increase in housing prices.[77] Population density Note: This text is
      entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city
      council. Aerial view of the centre and the Eixample, with the Serra de
      Collserola at the background. Barcelona is one of the most densely
      populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated
      the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality,
      giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per
      square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district. In the
      case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half
      of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge
      is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing
      less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca
      industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or
      slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 square
      kilometres (20 square miles) at an average density close to 28,500
      inhabitants per square kilometre. Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45
      had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre
      with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at
      an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most
      densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city
      population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words,
      936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per
      square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the
      neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely
      populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population
      density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. Age structure In
      1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged
      younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of
      the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9
      percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6
      percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed
      56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just
      6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5
      percent of the population.[78][79] Migration Largest groups of foreign

      about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5%
      coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the
      population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than
      doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6%
      respectively 3.9%.[75] The most important region of origin of migrants is
      Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75]
      Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia,
      Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many
      Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[81] There
      exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to
      twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more
      men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First
      Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the
      1990s.[82] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China
      and the Philippines.[75] There is a Japanese community clustered in
      Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods,
      and a Japanese international school serves that community.[83] Religion
      Main article: Religion in Barcelona Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor. Most
      of the inhabitants state they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[84] In a
      2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all
      ages identified themselves as Catholic.[85] This was the first time that
      more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic
      Christians.[85] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the
      numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[85] In 2019, a survey
      by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents
      in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics,
      43.3% non-practising Catholics).[86] The province has the largest Muslim
      community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim
      religion.[87] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to
      immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[84]
      In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona
      identified themselves as Muslim,[87] which makes 5.6% of total population.
      The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated
      3,500 Jews living in the city.[88] There are also a number of other
      groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma),
      Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[89] and
      Eastern Orthodox.[90] Economy General information A portion of the
      22@Barcelona business and innovation district The Barcelona metropolitan
      area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer
      regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with
      a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The
      greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion
      (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average),
      making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the
      European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[91] Barcelona city had a
      very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[92]
      Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest
      improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of
      2009.[93] Barcelona was the 24th most "livable city" in the world in 2015
      according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[94] Similarly, according to
      Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world
      on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[95] At the same time it is according
      to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable
      cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[96] Barcelona has a
      long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city
      industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already
      sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the
      first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since
      then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de
      Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the
      northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognised as
      the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its
      economic potential,[97] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[98]
      Trade fair and exhibitions The World Trade Center Barcelona The Palau de
      Congressos de Barcelona Drawing upon its tradition of creative art and
      craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design.
      It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second
      largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly
      growing number of national and international events each year (at present
      above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is
      405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa.
      However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the
      council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important
      business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in
      Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as
      world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición
      Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo
      1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban
      Forum.[99] Tourism Part of the beach promenade and the beach of La
      Barceloneta towards Port Olimpic Beaches of Barcelona, Spain Barcelona was
      the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the
      fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome,
      with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[100] By 2015, both Prague
      and Milan had more international visitors.[101] With its Rambles,
      Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[102]
      Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous
      recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[103][104] mild
      and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World
      Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[105] including 35 five star
      hotels,[106] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx
      of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to
      deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen
      items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take
      precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the
      metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is
      considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and
      personal safety,[107] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy
      that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to
      be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.[108]
      While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one
      report,[citation needed] the city is "overrun [by] hordes of tourists". In
      early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing
      the city. Slogans included "Tourists go home", "Barcelona is not for sale"
      and "We will not be driven out". By then, number of visitors had increased
      from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62
      million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and
      overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30
      billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's
      identity.[109] A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper
      included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and
      included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, "We don't want the city to become
      a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]". To moderate the problem, the city
      has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it
      also fined AirBnb with a €30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional
      tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[110] One
      industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel
      agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors
      that are causing an "overtourism crisis" in several major European cities.
      "Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing,
      infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake
      in the city's success.", he said.[111] "Managing tourism more responsibly
      can help", Francis later told a journalist, "but some destinations may
      just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that".[112]
      Manufacturing sector Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic
      product (GDP) of the region,[113] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy
      industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[114] The Barcelona
      metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments
      in Catalonia as of 1997.[115] Barcelona has long been an important
      European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile
      factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America,
      Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa,
      David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde,

      Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[116][117] Today, the
      headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile
      manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in
      the logistics and industrial area of the city.[118] The factory of Derbi,
      a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near
      the city.[119] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has
      long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very
      important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical,
      pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in
      telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress,
      and information technology services. Fashion The Brandery fashion show of
      2011 Main article: Fashion in Barcelona The traditional importance of
      textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion
      centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion
      capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of
      2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009,
      when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This
      was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in
      just three days.[120][121] Since 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion
      show, has been held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the
      Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion
      capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital
      of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[122] Government

      seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of
      particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High
      Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the
      Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is
      governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a
      four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in
      Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta
      Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960
      and amended later, but the current version was approved in March
      2006.[123] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in
      two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one
      executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions
      taken on the political level.[124] This law also gives the local
      government a special relationship with the central government and it also
      gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive
      commissions.[125] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like
      telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also
      gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the
      council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government,
      but that will need a favourable report from the council.[123] The City
      Hall of Barcelona The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the
      executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5
      lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of
      government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[126] The plenary, formed by the
      41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal
      executive functions.[127] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City
      council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field
      of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors
      proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the
      plenary.[128] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city
      planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security
      through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance,
      gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries,
      sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social
      welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the
      Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields
      with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social
      services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the
      Generalitat to plan and manage services.[129] The Saló de Cent, in the
      City Hall of Barcelona The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal
      Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments
      which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities
      of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[130]
      The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the
      seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish
      democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute
      majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007
      election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC
      governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32
      years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal
      election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and
      ERC 2. Districts Districts of Barcelona Main article: Districts of
      Barcelona See also: Street names in Barcelona Since 1987, the city has
      been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan,
      distritos in Spanish): Ciutat Vella Eixample Sants-Montjuïc Les Corts
      Sarrià-Sant Gervasi Gràcia Horta-Guinardó Nou Barris Sant Andreu Sant
      Martí The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several
      are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th
      centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district
      has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each
      district council depends on the number of votes each political party had
      in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a
      different party than the executive council. Education Main article:
      Education in Spain Main hall of the University of Barcelona Roger de
      Llúria building at Campus de la Ciutadella, Pompeu Fabra University
      Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public
      universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona
      (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra
      University.[131][132] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University
      of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded
      in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager
      training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as
      well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull
      University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE
      Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public
      university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area.
      Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private
      Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city
      has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the
      responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum
      is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also
      many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools
      receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection
      by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular
      guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles
      concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely
      private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools
      and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan
      Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by
      teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by
      teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme
      adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language
      (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a
      maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in
      Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign
      language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer
      International Baccalaureate programmes. Culture Main article: Culture of
      Barcelona Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival
      of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the
      dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from
      the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is
      designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities
      Study Group and Network.[133] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative
      Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[134] Entertainment and
      performing arts Main article: List of theatres and concert halls in
      Barcelona The Liceu opera house Barcelona has many venues for live music
      and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera
      house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau
      de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the
      Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica
      de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest
      symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new
      venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75
      concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[135] It is home
      to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major
      thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers.
      Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar
      Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving
      alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving
      international attention.[136] Barcelona is an international hub of highly
      active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying
      open well past midnight.[137] Media El Periódico de Catalunya, La
      Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first
      two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport
      and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports
      daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served
      by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in
      Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like El
      Pais (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in
      Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all
      bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also
      the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions). Several
      major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER.
      Barcelona also has a local TV station, BTV, owned by city council. The
      headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are
      located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Sports Main
      article: Sport in Barcelona Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc (Barcelona Olympic
      Stadium) built for the 1936 Summer Olympics named People's Olympiad, main
      stadium of 1992 Summer Olympics Barcelona has a long sporting tradition
      and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several
      matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has
      hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation
      needed] The Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe FC Barcelona is a
      sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest
      and the second richest in the world.[138] It has 74 national trophies
      (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with
      being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies
      out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals.
      The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only
      2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from
      FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in
      other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol
      (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey
      (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby
      union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European
      competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia.
      The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular
      interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower
      categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball
      team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.
      Palau Sant Jordi (St. George's sporting arena) and Montjuïc Communications
      Tower Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou,
      the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly
      owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for
      the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500.
      Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi
      (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal
      Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of
      7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and
      concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000
      (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the
      Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was
      the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held
      at the Palau San Jordi.[139] Circuit de Catalunya/Circuit de Barcelona,
      race track of Formula 1 and MotoGP on the suburb of Barcelona Several road
      running competitions are organised year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona
      Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de
      Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000
      participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the
      Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There's also the Ultratrail
      Collserola which passes 85 kilometres (53 miles) through the Collserola
      forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis
      tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis
      Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across
      the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[140] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló,
      the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the
      Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the
      Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and
      cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there
      are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Top sport

      Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that
      effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed,
      immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and
      autonomists.[142] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200
      squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of
      inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world.
      He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to
      live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an
      anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new
      houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers,
      lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a
      number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle
      repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free
      libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes,
      theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[143] The
      squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests
      throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.
      Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with
      waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.
      Transport Main article: Transport in Barcelona Airports Barcelona–El Prat
      Airport as seen from the air Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat
      Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is
      the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean
      coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing
      an annual upward trend.[144] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and
      Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly
      serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer
      destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is
      connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2
      stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and
      scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered
      service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa
      Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48
      mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the
      west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby
      town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.
      Seaport The Port of Barcelona The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old
      history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's
      ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in
      2013.[145] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10
      km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the
      commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is
      undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting
      the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south.[146]
      Port Vell in winter The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser
      port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[147] In 2013, 3.6
      million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[145] The
      Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex
      cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums –
      Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22
      basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being
      situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in
      the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. National and
      international rail The main railway station Estació de Sants Barcelona is
      a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail
      station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França
      terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium
      distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the
      Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed
      for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in
      2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared
      RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris,
      Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line)
      was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal
      station.[148][149] Metro and regional rail Barcelona Metro Barcelona is
      served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a
      metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars,
      rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and
      lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated
      into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del
      Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to
      6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[150] The Barcelona
      Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an "L" followed by the
      line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs
      underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the
      Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are
      operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some
      of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city
      Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de
      Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in
      the surrounding region. Tram Barcelona Tram The city's two modern tram
      systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[151] A heritage
      tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and
      the Funicular del Tibidabo.[152] Funicular and cable car Barcelona's metro
      and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars
      and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC
      operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the
      Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc
      up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car,
      which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs
      via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Bus Buses in
      Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local,
      interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the
      TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private
      companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private
      bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with
      its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former
      railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves
      as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Taxi Two
      typical Barcelona taxis Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the
      Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of
      more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of
      self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's
      taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks,
      hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[153][154] On 22 March
      2007,[155] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle
      service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user
      card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations
      spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and
      then leave it at another station.[156] The service has been a success,
      with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[157] Roads and highways B-20
      motorway in Barcelona Barcelona lies on three international routes,
      including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast,
      European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris.
      It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways
      throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17,
      C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or
      bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral
      (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts:
      Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two
      partially covered[158] fast highways with several exits that bypass the
      city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it
      diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with
      Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the
      city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard
      of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an
      important pedestrian route. Main sights Sagrada Família church, designed
      by Gaudí The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of
      the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times,
      some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan
      modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in
      the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important
      legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites.
      Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be
      seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still
      unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under
      construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of
      2015, completion is planned for 2026.[159] Barcelona was also home to Mies
      van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International
      Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise
      modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is
      more" and "God is in the details."[160] The Barcelona pavilion was
      intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a
      year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects
      now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the
      1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[161] the first (and as of
      2015, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual
      architect. Plaça Reial Barcelona Cathedral (original) - Cathedral at night

      Barcelona The National Museum of Art of Catalonia stands out for its
      collection of Romanesque painting, considered one of the most complete in
      Europe.[citation needed] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which
      cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia
      possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona
      Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art.
      The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold
      important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can
      Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila
      Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like
      the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of
      Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of
      Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian
      Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones,
      while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of
      the Year Award in 2006.[citation needed] The Museum of Natural Sciences of
      Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of "Museo Martorell de
      Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales"[163][164] (Spanish for "Martorell Museum
      of Archaeology and Natural Sciences"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural
      Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural
      Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the
      Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public
      from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the
      Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the
      Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical
      garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the
      Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third
      most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors
      in 2013.[165] Parks Parc de la Ciutadella north of La Barceloneta
      Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic,
      five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and
      six of which are forest.[166] They range from vest-pocket parks to large
      recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or
      1,358.3 acres).[65] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres)
      per year,[167] with a proportion of 18.1 square metres (195 sq ft) of park
      area per inhabitant.[168] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest,
      with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name.[65] It is followed
      by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old military
      citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and
      several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó
      Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha
      or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal
      Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central
      Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park
      (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres),
      named after the garden maze it contains.[65] There are also several
      smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres).

      A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura
      World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per
      year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[169][170] Also, within
      the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza
      del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Beaches Beaches of
      Barcelona Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top
      ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[103] and
      Discovery Channel.[171] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5
      kilometres (2+3⁄4 miles) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and
      Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[65] are the
      largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic
      Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell,
      Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to
      640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city
      restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of
      industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is
      artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large
      quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city
      a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's
      coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access
      during summer season. Other sights Santa Maria del Mar church Santa Maria
