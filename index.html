      a fullscreen view Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ BAR-sə-LOH-nə, Catalan:
      [bəɾsəˈlonə], Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona]) is a city on the coast of
      northeastern Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous
      community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality
      of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its
      urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the
      Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making
      it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris,
      the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises
      on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the
      rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de
      Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680
      feet) high. Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became
      the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of
      Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which
      continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the
      most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and
      administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia,
      wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic
      union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492.
      Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural
      centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the
      architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which
      have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two
      of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona
      and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the
      Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the
      1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions
      and also many international sport tournaments. Barcelona is a major
      cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[8] as
      well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[9] As a leading world city,
      Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for
      global city status (Beta +).[10] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the
      Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest
      European passenger port,[11] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat
      Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year,[12] an
      extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to
      France and the rest of Europe.[13] Contents 1 Names 2 History 2.1

      Gerenal references 15 External links Names The name Barcelona comes from
      the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found
      on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as Barkeno in Levantine
      Iberian script,[14] in ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών,
      Barkinṓn;[15][16] and in Latin as Barcino,[17] Barcilonum[18] and
      Barcenona.[19][20][21] Some older sources suggest that the city may have
      been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed
      to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[22] but there is no
      evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its
      name in antiquity, Barcino, had any connection with the Barcid family of
      Hamilcar.[23] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as
      Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.
      Internationally,[citation needed] Barcelona's name is abbreviated
      colloquially to 'Barça' in reference to the football club FC Barcelona,
      whose anthem is the Cant del Barça "Barça chant". A common abbreviated
      form used by locals for the city is Barna. Another common abbreviation is
      'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat
      Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and
      Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., "Comital City" or "City of Counts"), owing
      to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[24] History Main
      article: History of Barcelona For a chronological guide, see Timeline of
      Barcelona. See also: Street names in Barcelona A marble plaque in the
      Museu d'Història de la Ciutat de Barcelona, dated from around 110–130 AD
      and dedicated to the Roman colony of Barcino Pre-history The origin of the
      earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The
      ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs
      and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[25][26] The founding of
      Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes
      the founding of the city to the mythological Hercules. The second legend
      attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical
      Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly
      named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[27] but
      there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.[23]
      Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd Century BC have
      been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno
      written in an ancient script in the Iberian language. Thus, we can
      conclude that the Laietani, an ancient Iberian (Pre-Roman) people of the
      Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of
      Barcelona around 3 – 2 BC, called the area Bàrkeno, which means "The Place
      of the Plains" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[28] Roman Barcelona In about 15
      BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred
      on the "Mons Taber", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan
      Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of
      the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where
      current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political center of the city,
      Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2000
      years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[29]
      or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[30] or Colonia
      Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[31] mentions it
      among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its
      neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later
      writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it
      was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[32] It enjoyed
      immunity from imperial burdens.[33] The city minted its own coins; some
      from the era of Galba survive. The Mare de Déu de la Mercè statue on the
      Basílica de la Mercè Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del
      Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA);
      the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the
      historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining
      fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the
      cathedral.[34] The cathedral, known very formally by the long name of
      Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La
      Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in
      Catalan.[35][36] It is said to have been founded in 343. Medieval
      Barcelona The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th
      century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being
      conquered by the Arabs in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a
      siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of
      the Carolingian "Hispanic March" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by
      the Count of Barcelona.[37] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly
      independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern
      Catalonia, although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of
      Almanzor.[38] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's
      population was either killed or enslaved.[39] In 1137, Aragon and the
      County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[40][41] by the marriage of
      Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by
      only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne
      in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon,
      which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western
      Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as
      far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade
      centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was
      eclipsed by Valencia.[42] It initially fed from eastern and balkan slave
      stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of
      slaves.[43] The Bank of Barcelona or Taula de canvi, often viewed as the
      oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in
      1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of
      Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[44] Barcelona in 1563
      Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy The marriage of Ferdinand II of
      Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the two royal lines.
      Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the
      Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of
      Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism,
      including the Catalan Revolt (1640–52) against Philip IV of Spain. The
      great plague of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.[45] The fortress
      at Montjuïc, the most southerly point from which measurements were made
      when calculating the meridional definition of the metre In the 18th
      century, a fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. In
      1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre François
      André Méchain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk
      that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.[46] The
      definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the
      French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was
      negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of
      industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve. The Spanish
      Civil War and the Franco period Barcelona was the capital of the Republic
      of Spain from November 1937 until January 1939.[47][48] During that
      Spanish Civil War period, both Barcelona and Madrid were still under the
      rule of the republic. In the image Azaña and Negrín on the city outskirts.
      During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were
      resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were
      collectivised by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican
      government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the
      effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the
      city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops,
      after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city
      on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the
      French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to
      have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The
      autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[49] and the use of
      the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the
      second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was
      relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the
      civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of
      Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to
      rapid urbanisation. Late twentieth century In 1992, Barcelona hosted the
      Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major
      changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As
      part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the
      sea-front were demolished and 3 kilometres (2 miles) of beach were
      created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%,
      the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and
      beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the
      city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city
      was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city
      destination in the world and the 5th amongst European
      cities.[50][51][52][53][54] Recent history Main articles: History of
      Barcelona and Timeline of Barcelona Supporters of Catalan independence in
      October 2019 Protest against independence in October 2017 The death of
      Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain.
      Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered
      that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its
      support of the Republican government.[55] Massive, but peaceful,
      demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the
      streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It
      was granted less than a month later.[56] The development of Barcelona was
      promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European
      Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the
      1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been
      rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of
      the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led
      to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades
      of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This
      decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration
      (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]
      In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August
      2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and
      injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place
      elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called
      the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed
      indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and
      the Levant (ISIL).[60][61][62] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the
      focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement,
      its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and
      later protests.[63] Geography A panoramic view of Barcelona Location
      Barcelona as seen by the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-2
      mission Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian
      Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3
      mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river
      to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[64] This plain covers
      an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[64] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[65] are
      occupied by the city itself. It is 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of the
      Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft)
      high, offers striking views over the city[66] and is topped by the 288.4 m
      (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible
      from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of
      them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon
      them, such as Carmel (267 metres or 876 feet), Putget (es) (181 metres or
      594 feet) and Rovira (261 metres or 856 feet). The escarpment of Montjuïc
      (173 metres or 568 feet), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour
      and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th
      centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today,
      the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and
      cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city
      borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià
      de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de
      Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de
      Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del
      Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two
      small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. Climate Main article:
      Climate of Barcelona According to the Köppen climate classification,
      Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters
      and warm to hot summers,[67] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and
      spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry
      season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical
      Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than
      February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype,
      labelled as "Portuguese" by the French geographer George Viers after the
      climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[68] and found in the NW
      Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the
      humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is
      densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island
      effect. Areas outside of the urbanised districts can have as much as 2 °C
      of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[69] Its average annual
      temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at
      night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F).
      In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to
      18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and
      the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[70] In the warmest month,
      August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F)
      during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea
      temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[70] Generally, the summer or "holiday"
      season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and
      November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68
      °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and
      11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the
      coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the
      day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare,
      particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm
      sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of
      Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but
      light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such
      as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[71] Barcelona
      averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative
      humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall
      totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and
      lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter
      minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from
      138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10
      hours of sunshine a day) in July.[72] Climate data for Barcelona Can

      (Barcelona–El Prat Airport) (1981-2010) at 15 kilometres (9.3 mi)) from
      the city centre of Barcelona. Demographics Demographic evolution,
      1900–2007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estadística
      According to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1
      January 2016 was 1,608,746 people,[75] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq
      mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater
      Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 square
      kilometres (246 square miles) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The
      population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus
      of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of
      5,474,482.[4] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according
      to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and
      it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken
      in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can
      speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[76] Knowledge of Catalan
      has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language
      immersion educational system. In 1900, Barcelona had a population of
      533,000,[64] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started
      absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of
      Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell
      throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of
      life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After
      bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population
      began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great
      increase in housing prices.[77] Population density Note: This text is
      entirely based on the municipal statistical database provided by the city
      council. Aerial view of the centre and the Eixample, with the Serra de
      Collserola at the background. Barcelona is one of the most densely
      populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated
      the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality,
      giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per
      square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district. In the
      case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half
      of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge
      is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing
      less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca
      industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or
      slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 square
      kilometres (20 square miles) at an average density close to 28,500
      inhabitants per square kilometre. Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45
      had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre
      with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at
      an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most
      densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city
      population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words,
      936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per
      square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the
      neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely
      populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population
      density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. Age structure In
      1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged
      younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of
      the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9
      percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6
      percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed
      56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just
      6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5
      percent of the population.[78][79] Migration Largest groups of foreign

      Honduras 11,744 Peru 10,558 Venezuela 10,185 Philippines 9,439 In 2016,
      about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5%
      coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the
      population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than
      doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6%
      respectively 3.9%.[75] The most important region of origin of migrants is
      Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75]
      Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia,
      Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many
      Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[81] There
      exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to
      twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more
      men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First
      Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the
      1990s.[82] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China
      and the Philippines.[75] There is a Japanese community clustered in
      Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods,
      and a Japanese international school serves that community.[83] Religion
      Main article: Religion in Barcelona Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor. Most
      of the inhabitants state they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[84] In a
      2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all
      ages identified themselves as Catholic.[85] This was the first time that
      more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic
      Christians.[85] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the
      numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[85] In 2019, a survey
      by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents
      in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics,
      43.3% non-practising Catholics).[86] The province has the largest Muslim
      community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim
      religion.[87] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to
      immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[84]
      In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona
      identified themselves as Muslim,[87] which makes 5.6% of total population.
      The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated
      3,500 Jews living in the city.[88] There are also a number of other
      groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma),
      Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[89] and
      Eastern Orthodox.[90] Economy General information A portion of the
      22@Barcelona business and innovation district The Barcelona metropolitan
      area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer
      regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with
      a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The
      greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion
      (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average),
      making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the
      European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[91] Barcelona city had a
      very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[92]
      Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest
      improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of
      2009.[93] Barcelona was the 24th most "livable city" in the world in 2015
      according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[94] Similarly, according to
      Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world
      on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[95] At the same time it is according
      to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable
      cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[96] Barcelona has a
      long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city
      industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already
      sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the
      first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since
      then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de
      Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the
      northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognised as
      the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its
      economic potential,[97] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[98]
      Trade fair and exhibitions The World Trade Center Barcelona The Palau de
      Congressos de Barcelona Drawing upon its tradition of creative art and
      craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design.
      It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second
      largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly
      growing number of national and international events each year (at present
      above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is
      405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa.
      However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the
      council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important
      business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in
      Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as
      world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición
      Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo
      1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban
      Forum.[99] Tourism Part of the beach promenade and the beach of La
      Barceloneta towards Port Olimpic Beaches of Barcelona, Spain Barcelona was
      the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the
      fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome,
      with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[100] By 2015, both Prague
      and Milan had more international visitors.[101] With its Rambles,
      Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[102]
      Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous
      recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[103][104] mild
      and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World
      Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[105] including 35 five star
      hotels,[106] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx
      of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to
      deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen
      items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take
      precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the
      metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is
      considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and
      personal safety,[107] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy
      that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to
      be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.[108]
      While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one
      report,[citation needed] the city is "overrun [by] hordes of tourists". In
      early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing
      the city. Slogans included "Tourists go home", "Barcelona is not for sale"
      and "We will not be driven out". By then, number of visitors had increased
      from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62
      million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and
      overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30
      billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's
      identity.[109] A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper
      included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and
      included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, "We don't want the city to become
      a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]". To moderate the problem, the city
      has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it
      also fined AirBnb with a €30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional
      tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[110] One
      industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel
      agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors
      that are causing an "overtourism crisis" in several major European cities.
      "Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing,
      infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake
      in the city's success.", he said.[111] "Managing tourism more responsibly
      can help", Francis later told a journalist, "but some destinations may
      just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that".[112]
      Manufacturing sector Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic
      product (GDP) of the region,[113] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy
      industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[114] The Barcelona
      metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments
      in Catalonia as of 1997.[115] Barcelona has long been an important
      European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile
      factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America,
      Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa,
      David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde,
      Automóviles España, Eucort, Fenix, Fábrica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga,

      Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[116][117] Today, the
      headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile
      manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in
      the logistics and industrial area of the city.[118] The factory of Derbi,
      a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near
      the city.[119] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has
      long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very
      important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical,
      pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in
      telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress,
      and information technology services. Fashion The Brandery fashion show of
      2011 Main article: Fashion in Barcelona The traditional importance of
      textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion
      centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion
      capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of
      2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009,
      when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This
      was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in
      just three days.[120][121] Since 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion
      show, has been held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the
      Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion
      capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital
      of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[122] Government
      and administrative divisions See also: Municipal elections in Barcelona
      and List of mayors of Barcelona Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya As
      the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the
      seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of
      particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High
      Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the
      Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is
      governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a
      four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in
      Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta
      Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960
      and amended later, but the current version was approved in March
      2006.[123] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in
      two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one
      executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions
      taken on the political level.[124] This law also gives the local
      government a special relationship with the central government and it also
      gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive
      commissions.[125] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like
      telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also
      gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the
      council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government,
      but that will need a favourable report from the council.[123] The City
      Hall of Barcelona The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the
      executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5
      lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of
      government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[126] The plenary, formed by the
      41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal
      executive functions.[127] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City
      council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field
      of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors
      proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the
      plenary.[128] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city
      planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security
      through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance,
      gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries,
      sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social
      welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the
      Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields
      with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social
      services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the
      Generalitat to plan and manage services.[129] The Saló de Cent, in the
      City Hall of Barcelona The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal
      Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments
      which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities
      of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[130]
      The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the
      seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish
      democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute
      majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007
      election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC
      governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32
      years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal
      election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and
      ERC 2. Districts Districts of Barcelona Main article: Districts of
      Barcelona See also: Street names in Barcelona Since 1987, the city has
      been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan,
      distritos in Spanish): Ciutat Vella Eixample Sants-Montjuïc Les Corts
      Sarrià-Sant Gervasi Gràcia Horta-Guinardó Nou Barris Sant Andreu Sant
      Martí The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several
      are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th
      centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district
      has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each
      district council depends on the number of votes each political party had
      in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a
      different party than the executive council. Education Main article:
      Education in Spain Main hall of the University of Barcelona Roger de
      Llúria building at Campus de la Ciutadella, Pompeu Fabra University
      Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public
      universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona
      (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra
      University.[131][132] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University
      of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded
      in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager
      training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as
      well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull
      University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE
      Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public
      university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area.
      Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private
      Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city
      has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the
      responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum
      is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also
      many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools
      receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection
      by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular
      guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles
      concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely
      private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools
      and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan
      Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by
      teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by
      teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme
      adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language
      (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a
      maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in
      Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign
      language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer
      International Baccalaureate programmes. Culture Main article: Culture of
      Barcelona Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival
      of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the
      dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from
      the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is
      designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities
      Study Group and Network.[133] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative
      Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[134] Entertainment and
      performing arts Main article: List of theatres and concert halls in
      Barcelona The Liceu opera house Barcelona has many venues for live music
      and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera
      house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau
      de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the
      Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica
      de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest
      symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new
      venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75
      concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[135] It is home
      to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major
      thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers.
      Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar
      Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving
      alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving
      international attention.[136] Barcelona is an international hub of highly
      active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying
      open well past midnight.[137] Media El Periódico de Catalunya, La
      Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first
      two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport
      and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports
      daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served
      by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in
      Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like El
      Pais (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in
      Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all
      bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also
      the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions). Several
      major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER.
      Barcelona also has a local TV station, BTV, owned by city council. The
      headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are
      located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Sports Main
      article: Sport in Barcelona Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc (Barcelona Olympic
      Stadium) built for the 1936 Summer Olympics named People's Olympiad, main
      stadium of 1992 Summer Olympics Barcelona has a long sporting tradition
      and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several
      matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has
      hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation
      needed] The Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe FC Barcelona is a
      sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest
      and the second richest in the world.[138] It has 74 national trophies
      (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with
      being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies
      out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals.
      The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only
      2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from
      FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in
      other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol
      (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey
      (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby
      union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European
      competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia.
      The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular
      interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower
      categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball
      team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.
      Palau Sant Jordi (St. George's sporting arena) and Montjuïc Communications
      Tower Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou,
      the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly
      owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for
      the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500.
      Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi
      (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal
      Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of
      7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and
      concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000
      (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the
      Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was
      the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held
      at the Palau San Jordi.[139] Circuit de Catalunya/Circuit de Barcelona,
      race track of Formula 1 and MotoGP on the suburb of Barcelona Several road
      running competitions are organised year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona
      Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de
      Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000
      participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the
      Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There's also the Ultratrail
      Collserola which passes 85 kilometres (53 miles) through the Collserola
      forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis
      tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis
      Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across
      the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[140] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló,
      the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the
      Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the
      Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and
      cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there
      are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Top sport

      Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that
      effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed,
      immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and
      autonomists.[142] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200
      squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of
      inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world.
      He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to
      live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an
      anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new
      houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers,
      lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a
      number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle
      repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free
      libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes,
      theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[143] The
      squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests
      throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.
      Police have repeatedly tried to shut down the squatters movement with
      waves of evictions and raids, but the movement is still going strong.
      Transport Main article: Transport in Barcelona Airports Barcelona–El Prat
      Airport as seen from the air Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat
      Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is
      the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean
      coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing
      an annual upward trend.[144] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and
      Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly
      serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer
      destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is
      connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2
      stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and
      scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered
      service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa
      Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48
      mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the
      west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby
      town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.
      Seaport The Port of Barcelona The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old
      history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's
      ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in
      2013.[145] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10
      km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the
      commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is
      undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting
      the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south.[146]
      Port Vell in winter The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser
      port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[147] In 2013, 3.6
      million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[145] The
      Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex
      cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums –
      Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22
      basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being
      situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in
      the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. National and
      international rail The main railway station Estació de Sants Barcelona is
      a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail
      station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França
      terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium
      distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the
      Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed
      for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in
      2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared
      RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris,
      Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line)
      was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal
      station.[148][149] Metro and regional rail Barcelona Metro Barcelona is
      served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a
      metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars,
      rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and
      lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated
      into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del
      Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to
      6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[150] The Barcelona
      Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an "L" followed by the
      line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs
      underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the
      Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are
      operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some
      of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city
      Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de
      Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in
      the surrounding region. Tram Barcelona Tram The city's two modern tram
      systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[151] A heritage
      tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and
      the Funicular del Tibidabo.[152] Funicular and cable car Barcelona's metro
      and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars
      and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC
      operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the
      Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc
      up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car,
      which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs
      via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Bus Buses in
      Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local,
      interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the
      TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private
      companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private
      bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with
      its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former
      railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves
      as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Taxi Two
      typical Barcelona taxis Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the
      Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of
      more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of
      self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's
      taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks,
      hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[153][154] On 22 March
      2007,[155] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle
      service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user
      card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations
      spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and
      then leave it at another station.[156] The service has been a success,
      with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[157] Roads and highways B-20
      motorway in Barcelona Barcelona lies on three international routes,
      including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast,
      European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris.
      It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways
      throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17,
      C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or
      bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral
      (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts:
      Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two
      partially covered[158] fast highways with several exits that bypass the
      city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it
      diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with
      Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the
      city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard
      of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an
      important pedestrian route. Main sights Sagrada Família church, designed
      by Gaudí The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of
      the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times,
      some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan
      modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in
      the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important
      legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites.
      Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be
      seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still
      unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under
      construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of
      2015, completion is planned for 2026.[159] Barcelona was also home to Mies
      van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International
      Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise
      modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is
      more" and "God is in the details."[160] The Barcelona pavilion was
      intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a
      year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects
      now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the
      1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[161] the first (and as of
      2015, only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual
      architect. Plaça Reial Barcelona Cathedral (original) - Cathedral at night

      Barcelona The National Museum of Art of Catalonia stands out for its
      collection of Romanesque painting, considered one of the most complete in
      Europe.[citation needed] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which
      cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia
      possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona
      Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art.
      The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold
      important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can
      Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila
      Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like
      the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of
      Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of
      Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian
      Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones,
      while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of
      the Year Award in 2006.[citation needed] The Museum of Natural Sciences of
      Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of "Museo Martorell de
      Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales"[163][164] (Spanish for "Martorell Museum
      of Archaeology and Natural Sciences"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural
      Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural
      Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the
      Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public
      from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the
      Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the
      Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical
      garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the
      Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third
      most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors
      in 2013.[165] Parks Parc de la Ciutadella north of La Barceloneta
      Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic,
      five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and
      six of which are forest.[166] They range from vest-pocket parks to large
      recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or
      1,358.3 acres).[65] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres)
      per year,[167] with a proportion of 18.1 square metres (195 sq ft) of park
      area per inhabitant.[168] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest,
      with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name.[65] It is followed
      by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old military
      citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and
      several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó
      Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha
      or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal
      Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central
      Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park
      (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres),
      named after the garden maze it contains.[65] There are also several
      smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres).

      A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura
      World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per
      year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[169][170] Also, within
      the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza
      del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Beaches Beaches of
      Barcelona Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top
      ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[103] and
      Discovery Channel.[171] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5
      kilometres (2+3⁄4 miles) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and
      Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[65] are the
      largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic
      Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell,
      Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to
      640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city
      restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of
      industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is
      artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large
      quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city
      a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's
      coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access
      during summer season. Other sights Santa Maria del Mar church Santa Maria

      Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most goals in a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (96). Messi has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).
      
      Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain at the age of 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.
      
      An Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for appearances and is also the country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.
      
      Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.

      Early life
      Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[8] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[9] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[10] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[11][12]
      
      "When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive."
      
      – Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[13]
      A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[14][15] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[16] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[17][18] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".[19]
      
      
      Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, aged 13.
      As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[17][20] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[14][20][21]
      
      After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[22] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[23] Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[22][24] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[25] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[20][26][27]

      2003–2005: Rise to the first team
      "It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life."
      
      – Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[28]
      During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[29] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[30][31] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[32]
      
      At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[20][33] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[34] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[35] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[36][37]
      
      
      Messi playing against Málaga in 2005
      To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos.[30][38] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80 million.[30][39] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[40] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[30][38]
      
      During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[35][41] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[35] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[42][43] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.[20] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[37] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[41] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[42][44] Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.[45]
      
      2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player
      "In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy' shirt of one of the world's great clubs."
      
      – Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[46]
      On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.[39] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[46] While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, who were willing to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[47] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[48] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[39][49]
      
      
      Messi during a training session with Barcelona in 2006
      Due to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[49][50] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o.[27][51][52] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[53][51] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, "We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea."[54] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League,[55] in a 5–0 win over Panathinaikos on 2 November 2005,[56] his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.[45][51]
      
      While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[57][58] Already an idol to the culés, the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[58][59] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[60][61] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[62] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[59] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[63] His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.[64]
      
      
      Messi making his Maradona-esque run against Getafe in 2007
      Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[65] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's second goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66 yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[17][66] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[67] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[68][69]
      
      After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname "Messiah" from the Spanish media.[17][70][71] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[72][73] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[74] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[75] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[76] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[75] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[77]
      
      2008–09: First treble
      After two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[52] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[78][79] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[61][80] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[72][81]
      
      
      Messi aiming to shoot during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United
      In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside Eto'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[82][83] During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[84][85] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[86] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[82][87]
      
      As the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[88] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[84] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[89] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[78]
      
      2009–10: First Ballon d'Or
      His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[90] After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[91] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[72]
      
      "Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He's [like] a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make."
      
      – Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[92]
      The new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16.[93] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club's summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimović occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[94] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[95][96] He scored all of his side's four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in the competition.[97] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year.[98] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[96][99]
      
      2010–2011: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League
      Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat.[100] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[101] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[102][103] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[72][104] Under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.[104]
      
      Towards the end of the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in the span of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[105] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[106][107] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory.[108][109] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league's top assist provider with 18.[110][111] He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, becoming Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.[110][112]

      As Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[113] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[114][115][116] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals.[117][118] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[119] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[120] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[121] By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[21]
      
      2012: A record-breaking year
      "I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's impossible, this kid is unique."
      
      – Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer at the age of 24 in March 2012[122]
      As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[123][124] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[125][126] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[127]

      Despite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end.[128] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[129][130] In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[131] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[132][133]
      
      Under manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in Spanish football.[134] A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[135] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed "with respect and admiration", after breaking his 40-year record.[136] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[137] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[138][139] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[137][140]
      
      2013–2014: Messidependencia
      Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health.[141] After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi.[142] Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13 million.[143][144] He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[145] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.[146]

      After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[148] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[148]

      Messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[149] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[150][151] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[152][153] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[154][155] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[156]
      
      During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[157][158] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[157][159] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[158][160] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[161] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[162] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[163] amid strong interest from Mourinho's Chelsea.[164]

      Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[165] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[166] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[167] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[168]
      
      At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed "MSN", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[169][170] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[170][171] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[172][173] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[174]

      Towards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[175] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[176] As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 3] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[177][178][179] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[180]
      
      In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[181] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[182][183] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[184][185] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[174] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[186][187] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[188]

      Messi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[189] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[190] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[191] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[192] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[193]
      
      On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[194] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[195] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as "a touch of genius", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, "Barca's forwards are very respectful." The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was "very happy" with the play, insisting "it was legal and entertaining".[196][197]
      
      On 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 1–3 away win against Sporting de Gijón.[198] A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona's 0–2 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona's 10,000th in official competitions.[199] On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona's 2–1 home loss to Valencia.[200] Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona's 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season.[201] In total, Messi scored 41 goals as Barcelona's attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[202]

      – In an interview with Barcelona's official magazine, Javier Mascherano outlines Messi's importance to the team.[203]
      Messi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta;[204] he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August,[205] and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August.[206] Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6–2 against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season.[207] On 13 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player. A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks.[208] He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October.[209] Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4–0.[210] On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl.[211]

      Messi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe's top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimović.[212] After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place – behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[213] On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman.[214] In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl's record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).[215]
      
      On 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[216] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[217] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.[218] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey Final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.[219] In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[220]
      
      2017–18: Domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot
      Messi opened the 2017–18 season by converting a penalty in Barcelona's 1–3 first leg home defeat to Real Madrid in Supercopa de España.[221] Thereby, Messi also extended his El Clásico goalscoring record with the goal being his 24th official and 25th overall.[222] On 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in Derbi barceloní, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals.[223] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3–0 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[224] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[225] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[226]
      
      On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3–1 home victory over Olympiacos.[227] Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart.[228] On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2–1 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.[229] Following the reception of his fourth Golden Boot, Messi signed a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November, keeping him with the club through the 2020–21 season. His buyout clause was set at €700 million.[230] On 7 January 2018, Messi made his 400th La Liga appearance with Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal Gerd Müller's record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of Europe's top five divisions.[231] A week later, he broke the record, scoring his 366th La Liga goal from a free kick in a 4–2 away win against Real Sociedad.[231]
      
      On 4 March, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1–0 home win over Atlético Madrid, in La Liga.[232] On 14 March, Messi scored his 99th and 100th Champions League goals in a 3–0 home win over Chelsea, becoming only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this landmark, in fewer appearances, at a younger age and having taken fewer shots than his Portuguese counterpart.[233] His opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of his career, as Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition for the eleventh consecutive season.[234] On 7 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Leganés including his sixth goal scored from a free-kick for the season, matching the record set by former teammate Ronaldinho.[235] He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth Golden Shoe award.[236] On 21 April, Messi scored Barcelona's second goal – his 40th of the season – in a 5–0 win over Sevilla in the 2018 Copa del Rey Final, later also setting up Suárez's second goal; this was Barcelona's fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall.[237] On 29 April, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 away win over Deportivo de La Coruña, which saw Barcelona claim their 25th league title.[238] On 9 May, Messi scored as Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[239]
      
      2018–19: Captain, 10th La Liga title, and a record sixth Golden Boot
      With the departure of former captain Andrés Iniesta in May 2018, Messi was named the team's new captain for the following season.[240] On 12 August, he lifted his first title as Barcelona's captain, the Supercopa de España, following a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. On 19 August, Messi scored twice in helping Barcelona defeat Alavés 3–0 in their first La Liga match of the season, with his first goal, a free kick that he rolled under the jumping Alavés wall, making history in being Barcelona's 6000th goal in La Liga.[241] On 18 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over PSV Eindhoven in Barcelona's opening Champions League group stage match of the season, setting a new record for most hat-tricks in the competition, with eight.[242] On 20 October, Messi scored in a 4–2 home win over Sevilla, but was later forced off in the 26th minute after falling awkwardly and injuring his right arm; tests later confirmed that he had fractured his radial bone, ruling him out for approximately three weeks.[243] On 8 December, Messi scored two free kicks – his ninth and tenth goals from set pieces during the calendar year – in a 4–0 away win over Derbi barceloní rivals Espanyol in La Liga; this was the first time ever that he had managed such a feat in the league. His first goal was also his 10th league goal of the season, making him the first player ever to reach double figures in La Liga for 13 consecutive seasons.[244]

      On 13 January 2019, Messi scored his 400th La Liga goal in his 435th league appearance in a 3–0 home win over Eibar, becoming the first player ever to manage this tally in just one of Europe's top five leagues.[245] On 2 February, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 draw against Valencia, with his first goal coming from the penalty spot, his 50th La Liga penalty goal; as such, he became only the third player in La Liga history after Cristiano Ronaldo and Hugo Sánchez to score 50 penalties in the competition.[246] Later that month, the club admitted they had begun preparations for Messi's future retirement.[247] On 23 February, Messi scored the 50th hat-trick of his career and also provided an assist for Suárez, as he helped Barcelona come from behind to achieve a 4–2 away victory over Sevilla in La Liga; the goal was also his 650th career goal for club and country at senior level.[248] On 16 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home victory over Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-finals to give Barcelona a 4–0 aggregate win, which saw Barcelona progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2015; these were also his first goals in the Champions League quarter-finals since 2013.[249][250]
      
      On 27 April, Messi came off the bench and scored the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Levante, which allowed Barcelona to clinch the league title;[251] this was his 450th La Liga appearance, and his first league title as Barcelona's captain.[252][253] On 1 May, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home win over Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals; his second goal of the match, a 35-yard free kick, was the 600th senior club goal of his career, all of which had been scored with Barcelona.[254] In the return leg six days later at Anfield, Barcelona suffered a 4–0 away defeat, which saw Liverpool advance to the final 4–3 on aggregate.[255] On 19 May, in Barcelona's final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 away draw against Eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, he equalled Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga.[256][257] He also captured his sixth Golden Shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016–17 season.[258] On 25 May, Messi scored his final goal of the season in a 2–1 defeat to Valencia in the 2019 Copa del Rey Final.[259]
      
      2019–20: A record sixth Ballon d'Or
      On 5 August 2019, it was announced that Messi would miss Barcelona's US tour after sustaining a right calf injury.[260] On 19 August, Messi's chipped goal from the edge of the box against Real Betis was nominated for the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award.[261] Later that month, he suffered another setback following the return of his calf injury, which ruled him out of the opening game of the season;[262] as a result, he was sidelined indefinitely, and was only expected to return to action with Barcelona after the September international break.[263] On 2 September, Messi was shortlisted as one of the three finalists for both the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award and the 2019 Best FIFA Men's Player Award, with Messi winning the latter on 23 September.[264][265]
      
      
      Messi's six Ballon d'Or awards on display in the FC Barcelona Museum. His record sixth from 2019 is at the front.
      Messi made his first appearance of the season on 17 September, and on 6 October he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4–0 home win over Sevilla; this was his 420th goal in La Liga, which saw him break Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 419 goals scored in Europe's top five leagues.[266] On 23 October, Messi scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a 2–1 away win over Slavia Prague, becoming the first player to score in 15 consecutive Champions League seasons (excluding qualifying rounds).[267] He also equalled Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo's shared record of the most sides scored against in the competition (33).[268] On 29 October, Messi scored in a 5–1 home win over Real Valladolid in La Liga; his first goal – a set piece from 35 yards – was the 50th free-kick of his career.[269] His goals (608) also saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo's senior goal tally (606) at club level.[270] On 9 November, Messi scored three goals (including two free kicks) in a 4–1 home win against Celta Vigo. This was his 34th hat-trick in La Liga, equalling Cristiano Ronaldo's Spanish top-flight record.[271] On 27 November, in what was his 700th appearance for Barcelona, Messi scored one goal and assisted two more in a 3–1 home win over Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League. Dortmund were the 34th team he had scored against in the competition, breaking the previous record of 33 held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl.[272] On 2 December, Messi was awarded a record-breaking sixth Ballon d'Or.[273] On 8 December, Messi scored his record-breaking 35th hat-trick in La Liga with three goals in Barcelona's 5–2 home win over Mallorca.[274]
      
      On 22 February 2020, Messi scored four goals in a 5–0 home win over Eibar in La Liga.[275] On 14 June, he scored in a 4–0 away win against Mallorca, becoming the first player ever in La Liga to score 20 goals or more in 12 consecutive seasons.[276] On 30 June, he scored a panenka in a 2–2 home draw against Atlético Madrid in La Liga, to reach his 700th goal in his senior career for Barcelona and Argentina.[277] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi's record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[278][279] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe's top-five leagues.[279][280] Following his brace in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[281] On 9 August, in the Champions League round of 16 second leg versus Napoli at the Camp Nou, Messi scored the second goal and earned a penalty which led to a third goal and led his side to a 3–1 home victory and qualified 4–2 on aggregate for the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich.[282] On 15 August, Messi suffered his worst defeat as a player as Bayern Munich beat Barcelona 8–2 in a one-off tie in Lisbon, leading to another disappointing exit from the Champions League.[283]
      
      August 2020: Desire to leave Barcelona
      "I wasn't happy and I wanted to leave. I have not been allowed this in any way and I will stay at the club so as not to get into a legal dispute. The management of the club led by Bartomeu is a disaster. My love for Barça will never change."
      
      – Messi on reversing his decision to leave Barcelona in an interview with Goal on 4 September 2020.[284]
      Following growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[285] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club "a document expressing his desire to leave" on 25 August 2020.[286] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi's statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[287] On 26 August, Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club's desire to "build a team around the most important player in the world"[288] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi's contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player's representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season.[289] On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi's contract and buyout clause were still active.[290]
      
      On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel's father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause "is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player's unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season", as stated in Messi's contract with Barcelona;[291] moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[292] Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[293] This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying "I would never go to court against the club of my life".[294]
      
      2020–21: Final season at Barcelona
      On 27 September, Messi began the 2020–21 season by scoring a penalty in a 4–0 home win against Villarreal in La Liga.[295] Two days prior to the opening game, he again criticised the club, this time for the manner of Luis Suárez's departure, stating, "at this stage nothing surprises me any more".[296] On 20 October, Messi scored a penalty in a 5–1 home victory against Ferencváros in the Champions League, becoming the first player in history to score in sixteen consecutive Champions League seasons.[297] On 25 November, Messi was nominated for the 2020 Best FIFA Men's Player award, and was later shortlisted as one of the final three candidates.[298][299] On 29 November, Messi scored his side's fourth goal in their 4–0 victory over Osasuna. After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell's Old Boys, in tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both hands to the screen showing Maradona's face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[300] On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men's Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.[301]
      
      On 23 December, Messi scored his 644th goal for Barcelona against Real Valladolid in La Liga, surpassing Pelé with Santos as the player with the most goals scored for a single club.[302][303] In order to celebrate his achievement, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against.[304] On 17 January 2021, Messi was sent off for the first time in his club career for violent conduct (swinging an arm at the head of Asier Villalibre, missed initially by the referee but reviewed via VAR) in the final minutes of Barcelona's 2–3 extra time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the 2020–21 Supercopa de España Final.[305] On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1–1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2–5 after having lost 1–4 at home on 16 February, with Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game.[306] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4–1 win against Huesca. With the first goal, he became the first player in football history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top five European leagues.[307] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6–1 away win against Real Sociedad.[308] On 17 April, Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the 2021 Copa del Rey Final. With his second goal, he broke Gerd Müller's record of 30 plus goals in 12 consecutive club seasons, setting a new record of 13. With his 35th trophy with Barcelona, Messi also overtook former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs as the most decorated footballer for a single club.[309][310] On 16 May, Messi scored his 30th league goal of the campaign in a 1–2 home defeat against Celta Vigo, which later turned out to be his final goal and match in a Barcelona shirt.[311]
      
      The top goalscorer in La Liga, Messi was announced as the winner of the Pichichi trophy for a record eighth time in his career.[312] It was also his record fifth consecutive win in La Liga, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano and Hugo Sánchez who both had four for Real Madrid,[312] and equalled former Marseille striker Jean-Pierre Papin's record of five consecutive league top scorer awards in the top five leagues of Europe.
      
      "Leo wanted to stay and the Club wanted him to stay but with the La Liga rules it has not been possible. To comply with the league's fair play regulations we had to accept an agreement that mortgaged the Club's TV right for half a century and FC Barcelona is above everything else."
      
      – Barcelona president Joan Laporta explains the reason behind Messi's departure.[313]
      On 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[314] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[315] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day.[316] The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[317] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi's exit by saying "the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board", he added by saying "the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary".[318] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[319]

      2021–22: Seventh Ballon d'Or and first season adjustments
      
      Messi (middle) with PSG team-mates Kylian Mbappé (left) and Neymar
      On 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain.[320] He signed a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[321] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[322]
      
      Messi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of a 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1.[323] He made his first start and Champions League debut for the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September.[324] Four days later, Messi made his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[325] On 28 September, he scored his first goal for the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box in a 2–0 Champions League group stage win over Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.[326] On 21 November, Messi scored his first Ligue 1 goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes.[327] Later that month, he provided a hat-trick of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home.[328] Having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or on 29 November.[329]
      
      "I think about being able to reverse the situation, about not having the feeling of having changed clubs and that it didn’t go well for me. I’m already prepared for what’s to come, I know the club, I know the city, I’m a little more comfortable with the dressing room, with my teammates and I know it’s going to be different."
      
      – Messi on his difficult first season at PSG and how he wants to improve in his second season in an interview with TyC Sports.[330]
      On 2 January 2022, PSG announced that Messi had tested positive for COVID-19, missing two league games and a cup game as a result.[331][332] He made his return against on 23 January in the league against Reims where he came on as a substitute in the second half and assisted PSG's third goal in a 4–0 home victory.[333] On 13 March, following their Champions League elimination against Real Madrid in the round of 16, Messi and his team-mate Neymar were booed by some of the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes in the league match against Bordeaux.[334][335] Then-PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino defended Messi by saying "To judge Messi in this way is unfair," adding "It was a year of learning, and not just on a professional level coming to Paris Saint-Germain, in a new league and with new teammates, but also on a family level."[336] On 23 April, he helped PSG clinch their 10th Ligue 1 title after scoring from a strike outside the 18-yard box in a 1–1 draw against Lens at home.[337] Messi finished his debut season with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions.[338] He failed to reach double figure league goals for the first time since 2005–06, ending the campaign with 6.[339]
      
      2022–23: Regained form
      After adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in a attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31 July by scoring PSG's first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions, winning his second trophy with the club.[340]
      
      Due to his previous form last season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d'Or award for the first time since 2005.[341] On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbappé, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1's second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7–1 away win over Lille.[342][343] The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in September.[344] On 5 October, he scored in a 1–1 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition's history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents.[345] On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7–2 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals.[346] Four days later, Messi scored and provided an assist as PSG won 4–3 against Troyes to remain top of the Ligue 1 table. The goal was his seventh of the league season and his twelveth overall, surpassing his total output of eleven goals in all competitions during the 2021–22 season in just 18 matches.[347][348]
      
      International career
      2004–2005: Success at youth level
      As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[349] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[350]
      
      Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[351][352] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[352]
      
      2005–2006: Senior and World Cup debuts
      In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[353] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[354] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his "re-debut" ahead of the match.[355] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel".[356] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[357] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[358]
      
      During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[359] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[360][361] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[362][363] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[364] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.[365][366]
      
      2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold
      
      Messi evades Brazil's Marcelo in the semi-final of the 2008 Summer Olympics
      As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[58][367] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[368][369] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[367] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[370] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[367] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[371]
      
      Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[372] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[373] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[374] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[375]
      
      2008–2011: Collective decline
      From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[367] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[357][376] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[377] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[357] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[378]
      
      
      Messi in action during the opening match against Bolivia at the 2011 Copa América
      Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[376] He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[379]
      
      Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[380] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.[381] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[382]
      
      Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[382][383] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[110][357] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[382]
      
      2011–2013: Assuming the captaincy
      
      Messi scored his first international hat-trick against Switzerland in 2012
      After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.[384][385] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[357][384]
      
      Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[357][384] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[386] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[357][387] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[384]

      Messi watches his 25-yard curling strike hit the net against Iran to win the game for Argentina in their second group game at the 2014 FIFA World Cup
      Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[388] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[389] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[390] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[391] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[392][393] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[394]
      
      
      Messi battles Germany's Mats Hummels for the ball during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final
      Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[395] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[396] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[388][397] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[398]
      
      Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[399][400] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[401] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[402] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[357][402]
      
      As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[403] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[404] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[403] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[405] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[406] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[407]
      
      2016–2017: Third Copa América final, retirement, and return
      Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[408] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[409] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[410] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[411]
      
      "Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, 'he's the top scorer for the Argentina national team.' But the advantage I have is that I'm second to an extraterrestrial."
      
      – Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[412]
      On 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[413] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[414] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[415] and was named man of the match once again.[416]
      
      During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[417] He stated, "I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made."[418] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States."[419] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[420] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[421]
      
      Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[422] He was greeted by fans with signs like "Don't go, Leo" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, "We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him."[423] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[424] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[425]

      – Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[426]
      Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[427] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[428] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[429]
      
      
      Messi celebrates his hat-trick against Ecuador in 2017 which saw Argentina qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup
      On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[430][431] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[432] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[433] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[433]
      
      2018: World Cup
      "The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]"
      
      – Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.[434]
      Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[435][436] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[437] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[438] In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying "we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle".[439] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, "Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone."[440]
      
      
      Messi celebrates his goal against Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup
      In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[441] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[442][443] He was awarded Man of the Match.[444] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[445] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[446] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[447][448]
      
      Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[449] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[450] A conversation with Scaloni and his idol Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire.[451] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[452]
      
      2019–2020: Copa América third-place, suspension and Superclásico victory
      On 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni's final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.[453] In Argentina's second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[454] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[455] Following Argentina's 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match,[456][457] and alleged the competition was "set up" for Brazil to win.[458]
      
      In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[459] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[460] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[461] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[462] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[463] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[464]

      On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[466] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[467] A week later, he broke the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[468] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[469] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[470][471] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[472] Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament's top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[473][474]
      
      
      Messi at the 2022 FIFA World Cup
      On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[475] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[476] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men’s top scorers.[477]
      
      At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0.[478] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance,[479] and also became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Ivan Hurtado, combined with surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team related records.[480][481][482] In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[483] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win.[484] Argentina advanced into the championship match against France, the team that had eliminated them four years prior, with Messi saying in advance that it would be his final World Cup appearance, and considerable media discussion of the game's potential implications for his legacy.[485][486]
      
      Player profile
      Style of play
      
      A versatile forward, Messi often plays as a classic number 10.
      Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[487][488] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").[489][490][491] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[14][488][492] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[493] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."[43] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[494][495]
      
      A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[496] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[497][498][499] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[488][500] As of October 2022, Messi ranks 9th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 60,[501] the most among active players.[502] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[503]
      
      
      Messi is known to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate attacking plays, and create goal-scoring opportunities.
      Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[492][500][504] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[505] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[506] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control."[495] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[487][488]
      
      Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[378] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[43] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[21] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[171][507] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[508][509] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[510] or even on the right wing[511] or as a false nine,[512][513] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[509] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his teams attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[514][515]
      
      
      Messi prepares to shoot with his dominant left foot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final
      As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[516][517][518] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[519] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[383][520]

      – Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[65]
      A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[58] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, "I'm not even the best at Barça", in reference to his protégé.[521][522] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[72] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[10][492][523] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[524] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[112][525] and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[526][527] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[528] until he won his first international trophy at the 2021 Copa América.[529]

      Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[18][376] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, "Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico."[530] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays "at the level of the best Maradona".[531] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[532][533][534]
      
      In Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[349][535][536] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[14][349] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[382] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy."[537] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, have also questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[538][539][540]
      
      Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo
      Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry
      
      Messi has been compared with Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers.
      Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[541][542]
      
      Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[543][544] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world:[157] since 2008, Messi has won seven Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[545] six FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[546] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players;[157][547] beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[548][549][550] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[551] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[551]
      
      In popular culture
      According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[162][552] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[553] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[554] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[555] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[78][79][143] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus.[556] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[556] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[557]
      
      In addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[558] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[559] Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[551] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[560][561] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[562] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[563]
      
      
      After blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[564] His goal celebration features in the FIFA video game series, first appearing in FIFA 14.
      As a commercial entity, Messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[565][566] From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[565][567] Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[568][569][570][571] Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[572][573]
      
      Messi's global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people as published by Time, in 2011 and 2012.[574][575] His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by August 2021 he had over 103 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[576][577] He also has over 340 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[578] According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[579][580] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a "tourist attraction".[581]

      Other events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.25 million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[582] A 2013 Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137 million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[583][584] World Press Photo selected "The Final Game", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[585] Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[586]
      
      In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, "sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends."[587] In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia’s tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia’s poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[588][589] In August 2022, Messi was urged by the family of Mohammed al Faraj to intervene on their son’s behalf after he was arrested in 2017 at the age of 15 for crimes against the Saudi regime and faced the death penalty.[590]
      
      Personal life
      Family and relationships
      Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[591] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[592] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.

      Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[594] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[595] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[596] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[597] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[598]
      
      Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[599]
      
      Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of "The Machine of '87" at Newell's Old Boys. He currently lives in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[14][600][601] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[602] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[603]
      
      Philanthropy
      Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[604][605] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[606] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[607]
      
      
      Messi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2010.
      In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[608] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[600] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[600][609] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global "Messi and Friends" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[610][611]
      
      Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[600] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[14] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[612] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[613] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[614] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[615]
      
      In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[616][617] In February 2021, Messi donated his Adidas shoes to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club, the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[618]
      
      In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[619] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones in Uruguay remarking that "Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones".[619]
      
      Tax fraud
      Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[620] Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things."[621]

      Notes
       According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single "Messi", in accordance with Argentine customs.[2][3] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double "Messi Cuccittini".[4] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: "The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders."[5]
       In addition to four FIFA Ballons d'Or, Messi received France Football's Ballon d'Or and FIFA's World Player of the Year award in 2009 prior to their incorporation; both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballons d'Or.[6][7] In 2019, he received a sixth Ballon d'Or and won the Best FIFA Men's Player, before receiving a seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.
       Assist statistics began in 1990.
       According to Bleacher Report's Richard Fitzpatrick, "Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment."[593]

  Xavier Hernández Creus (born 25 January 1980), known as Xavi is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who is the manager of La Liga club Barcelona. Widely considered one of the greatest midfielders of all time,[3][4] Xavi was renowned for his passing, vision, ball retention, and positioning.[5][6][7][8]
  
  Xavi joined La Masia, the Barcelona youth academy, at age 11, and made his first-team debut against Mallorca in August 1998. In all, he played 767 official matches, a former club record—now held by Lionel Messi—and scored 85 goals.[9] Xavi is the first player in the club's history to play 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined.[10] With Barcelona, Xavi won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. Xavi came third in the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, followed by third place for its successor award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, he was runner up to Messi for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. In 2015, he departed Barcelona for Al Sadd, where he won four trophies before retiring in 2019. He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,000 professional career appearances.
  
  With Spain, Xavi won the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1999, and the Olympic silver medal at the 2000 Olympics. After making his senior team debut in 2000, he was capped 133 times for his country, and was an influential figure in the team's successes. He played an integral role in Spain's victory at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as their wins at UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2012. He was named Player of the Tournament at UEFA Euro 2008,[11] and was named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament in 2008 and 2012. With two assists in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, Xavi became the first player to register assists in two separate European finals, after setting up the only goal in the final four years earlier.[12] After the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Xavi announced his retirement from international football.[13]
  
  Xavi was awarded the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker award four times, all straight between 2008 and 2011. He was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI on six occasions: 2008 to 2013, and the UEFA Team of the Year five times: 2008 to 2012. In 2020 Xavi was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by France Football magazine.[14] Xavi was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in 2012, and he won 32 trophies in his career, making him the second-most decorated Spanish player in history, behind former teammate Andrés Iniesta.[15][16][17] After retirement, Xavi transitioned to coaching, and he was named the manager at Qatar Stars League club Al Sadd in May 2019, where he won seven titles in less than three years. In November 2021, Xavi was appointed as manager at his former club Barcelona.

  Early life
  "I've been lucky enough to be brought up on the Barcelona ethos. Which has taught me the value of being part of a team. 'Today for you, tomorrow for me.' Those qualities are essential for life in general."
  
  —Xavi on learning the team ethos of Barcelona while at the club's youth system, La Masia.[18]
  Born in Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia,[19] Xavi is a product of FC Barcelona's La Masia youth system, which he joined at the age of 11 from UFB Jàbac Terrassa and Terrassa FC. His father, Joaquim, was a former player for Sabadell in the first division.[20] Xavi made his way through the youth and reserve teams and was a key member of Josep Maria Gonzalvo's Barcelona B team that won promotion to the Second Division.
  
  Although he was initially inspired by compatriot playmaker Pep Guardiola at Barcelona,[21] as a child Xavi also watched a lot of English football, and looked up to midfielders John Barnes, Paul Gascoigne and Matt Le Tissier.[22]
  
  Club career
  Barcelona
  1998–2001: Beginnings
  Xavi's progression through the teams earned him a first-team appearance in a Copa Catalunya match against Lleida on 5 May 1998[23] and he scored his first goal on 18 August 1998 in the 1998 Supercopa de España against Mallorca. His debut in La Liga came against Valencia on 3 October 1998 in a 3–1 victory for Barcelona. Initially featuring intermittently both for the reserve and senior teams, Xavi scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Real Valladolid when Barcelona were in tenth position in the league. Sustained impressive performances meant that he became a key member of Louis van Gaal's title-winning team, finishing his debut season with 26 matches played and being named 1999 La Liga Breakthrough Player of the Year. Xavi became Barcelona's principal playmaker after an injury to Pep Guardiola in the 1999–2000 season.[24][25]
  
  2001–2008: Breakthrough and vice-captaincy

  In these years, Barcelona was on the verge of bankruptcy and struggling to keep its place in La Liga's elite. Playing midfield, but in a more defensive role, Xavi made 20 assists and scored 7 goals in those two seasons. On 16 March 2002, he scored his first goal in El Clásico against Real Madrid.[26]
  
  Xavi was named the vice-captain in the 2004–05 season, in which he helped Barcelona win La Liga and the 2004 Supercopa de España.[27] He was named La Liga Spanish Player of the Year in 2005.[27]
  
  In the 2005–06 season, Xavi tore the ligaments in his left knee in training; he was out of action for four months but returned in April and was on the substitutes bench for Barcelona's win in the 2006 Champions League Final against Arsenal. He also won La Liga and the Supercopa de España again.[27]
  
  2008–2012: Sustained domestic and European success
  "Xavi is a player who has the Barcelona DNA: someone who has the taste for good football, someone who is humble and someone who has loyalty to this club. From the first moment I saw him play, I knew he would become the brain behind Barcelona for many years to come."
  
  —Former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, September 2008.[28]
  After being named Player of the Tournament at Euro 2008, Xavi spoke to Bayern Munich about a transfer, but newly appointed Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola convinced him that he was too important to the club to be allowed to leave.[29] He was a main part of Barcelona's treble and scored the fourth goal in the 4–1 win in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final against Athletic Bilbao, with a free kick. In La Liga, one of his most significant games was the 6–2 Clásico victory over Real Madrid on 2 May; he assisted four goals – once to Carles Puyol, once to Thierry Henry and twice to Lionel Messi.[30]
  
  Xavi helped Barcelona win the 2009 Champions League Final 2–0 against Manchester United, assisting the second goal by crossing to Messi for his header.[31] Prior to the match, Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson heaped praise on the central midfield combination of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, stating, "I don't think Xavi and Iniesta have ever given the ball away in their lives. They get you on that carousel and they can leave you dizzy."[32] Xavi was voted "UEFA Champions League best midfielder" for his contribution during Barcelona's victorious 2008–09 Champions League campaign.[33] Xavi was the highest assisting player in La Liga with 20,[34] and in the Champions League, with 7; he earned 29 assists overall that season. Xavi was under contract to Barça until 2014 after extending his contract during the 2008–09 season.[35] The new contract made him one of the club's biggest earners, with a salary of €7.5 million a year.[35]
  
  
  Xavi in action for Barcelona in 2008
  During the 2009–10 season, journalists increasingly noted Xavi's contribution to the Barcelona team. For example:
  
  "Quite simply the best midfielder of modern football. It could even be argued that Xavi and Matthäus are the two best in this position in history. World class for several years now, it is the past three seasons in particular where the 30-year-old has been untouchable. Xavi’s passing is up there with Michel Platini, he creates countless goals with genius through balls while virtually never relinquishing possession."[36]
  
  In the 2009–10 season, Xavi again topped the assists table and provided both the assists in Barcelona's 2–0 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. Barcelona won the Liga title with a record 99 points, and Xavi was acclaimed Barcelona's second-best player in a season-long vote.[37] On 3 June 2010, Madrid-based newspaper Marca awarded him third place in the annual Trofeo Alfredo di Stéfano award for the best player in La Liga, behind Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[38]
  
  "Our model was imposed by [Johan] Cruyff; it's an Ajax model. It's all about rondos [piggy in the middle]. Rondo, rondo, rondo"
  
  —Xavi speaking in 2011 about the tiki-taka passing style introduced to Barcelona by Johan Cruyff.[39]
  On 9 June 2010, Xavi signed a new four-year contract with the club, which could be automatically renewed up to 30 June 2016 based on number of games played.[40] On 29 November, he scored his third goal against arch-rivals Real Madrid in a 5–0 home win. On 18 December, he scored another goal against Espanyol in a 5–1 win. In the Champions League, Xavi scored a valuable goal with an assist from David Villa in a home win against Arsenal, that saw Barcelona progress to the quarter-finals.[41]
  
  Xavi was one of the three finalists for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or, and finished third in the vote behind his Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta.[42][43] He narrowly defeated Messi to win the Player of the Year award from World Soccer magazine.[44]

  On 2 January 2011, in a league match against Levante, Xavi made his 549th appearance for the club in all competitions, matching the record held by Migueli. Xavi later became the player with the most appearances for Barcelona of all time.[45] On 28 May, Xavi was imperious in the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final at Wembley Stadium in London as Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the showpiece for the second time in three seasons, winning 3–1.[27]
  
  Xavi began the 2011–12 season in fine goalscoring form and seemed to grow in his influence of the team despite the long-anticipated return of Cesc Fàbregas and the promotion of Thiago to create added competition for places in Barça's attacking midfield positions. On 18 December, in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup Final in Yokohama, Barcelona won 4–0 against Brazilian side Santos as Xavi scored a goal and made an assist to Lionel Messi.[46] After the ball was slightly behind him, Xavi brought the ball down with a cocked leg, effectively using his ankle to control it, before slipping a pass through to Messi, who scored the first goal.[46]
  
  Xavi scored the winning goal in the Group H game against A.C. Milan, a vital match for Barcelona's progression in the Champions League knockout stage. In total, Xavi had the best goalscoring return of his career in 2011–12 season with ten Liga goals, two in the Copa del Rey – which Barcelona won – and one in the Club World Cup final win.[27]
  
  2012–2015: Later years and departure
  
  Xavi as Barcelona captain in November 2012
  On 18 December 2012, Barcelona renewed Xavi's contract, extending it until 30 June 2016.[47] He scored a goal against Real Madrid in a 3–2 win for Barcelona. Xavi was named in the FIFA World XI, along with teammates Iniesta, Messi and Dani Alves.[48] Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season.[49][50]
  
  On 16 January 2014, Xavi made his 700th appearance for the first team against Getafe in the Copa del Rey.[51] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey Final by Real Madrid with Gareth Bale scoring a late winner, and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid.[52][53]
  
  In June 2014, it was announced that Xavi would be leaving the club.[54][55][56] On 22 July, however, after talks with newly appointed manager and former teammate Luis Enrique, Xavi decided to stay at Camp Nou for one more season.[57] He was also appointed as club captain. On 25 April 2015, Xavi made his 500th La Liga appearance, becoming the eighth player in history to do so.[58] On 4 June, a farewell event was held at Barcelona for Xavi with players, managers, friends and family paying tribute to him.[59][60]
  
  On 6 June 2015, Xavi came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Andrés Iniesta to make his 767th and final appearance for Barcelona during the 2015 Champions League Final, as the club won its fifth European Cup, beating Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion. Xavi, as club captain, lifted the trophy.[9][61] This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice.[62] Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Gerard Piqué, Pedro, Sergio Busquets and Dani Alves were part of both treble-winning teams.[62] Xavi's 767 appearances was a club record until surpassed by Lionel Messi in March 2021.[63]
  
  Al Sadd

  On 21 May 2015, Xavi announced that he would join Qatari club Al Sadd at the end of the 2014–15 season on a three-year contract. According to his agent, the deal would involve him becoming an ambassador for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and also start his coaching qualifications.[64] He made his debut for Al Sadd in a 4–0 win over Mesaimeer on 13 September 2015, assisting in the team's first goal.[65] In the following match, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Umm Salal.[66] Al Sadd ended the league campaign in third position putting them in a place for the next season's AFC Champions League, the elite club competition of the Asian Football Confederation. Xavi scored three goals during the season. In the Champions League, Al Sadd were knocked out from the qualifying rounds by Emirati side Al Jazira on penalties; Xavi missed his spot kick.[67]
  
  Xavi won his first trophy with Al Sadd following a 2–1 victory over El Jaish in the Qatar Cup final on 29 April 2017.[68] On 10 November 2017, Xavi said that he would retire when his contract with Al Sadd expired at the end of the 2017–18 season, and would later pursue a coaching career.[69] However, he postponed these plans and signed a two-year contract extension on 24 May 2018.[70] In October 2018, Al Sadd reached the 2018 AFC Champions League semi-finals of the tournament with Xavi as captain but were eliminated 2–1 by Persepolis.[71]
  
  On 2 May 2019, Xavi announced that he would be retiring from professional football at the end of the season.[72] On 20 May 2019, Xavi played the final match of his career, a 2–0 defeat to Persepolis in Tehran, Iran which was Al Sadd's final AFC Champions League group match; before the match, he stated that he would like to remain in Qatar after his retirement, and that he would look to begin a coaching career, commenting: "The idea is to start as a coach in Qatar, to test myself and get some experience."[73]
  
  International career
  
  Xavi playing for Spain
  Xavi played for Spain at the 2000 Olympics, 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, Euro 2008, 2009 Confederations Cup, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012, 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2014 World Cup. In 1999 he was part of the Spanish team that won FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria, with Xavi also scoring two goals in the tournament.[74]
  
  UEFA Euro 2008
  Xavi was named Euro 2008's player of the tournament after Spain defeated Germany 1–0 in the final.[75] Xavi was dominant in midfield, where his passing and reading of the game was pivotal to Spain's success, as he led his nation to their first silverware since the 1964 European Championship.[75] Andy Roxburgh, head of UEFA's Technical Committee, said, "We have chosen Xavi because he epitomizes the Spanish style of play. He was influential in the whole possession, passing and penetrating kind of game that Spain played."[11]
  
  Xavi scored the first goal in the semi-final against Russia, which Spain won 3–0.[76] In the final, he made the pass from which Fernando Torres scored the winning goal.[77]
  
  2010 World Cup
  
  Xavi at the 2010 FIFA World Cup
  Xavi was named in Spain's squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, with Spain eventually winning their first World Cup.[78] He provided the most accurate passes, 599 with a passing success rate of 91%, and he crossed the ball inside the 18-yard box more than any other player in the tournament. In the final he made 57 accurate forward half passes.[79] Xavi also covered 80.20 kilometres throughout the competitions, averaging approximately 11.5 kilometres per game,[80] more than any other player.[81] In the final, he covered a distance of almost 15 kilometres.[82]
  
  Xavi is the beating heart of this Spanish team, the man dictating the tiki-taka pulse of pass after pass. He may be just 5ft 7in with a curiously hunched gait but no player more influences the way his whole team plays. He doesn't score, doesn't really tackle: he just passes and passes with a precision and wit unmatched by any of his peers.
  
  — Duncan White of The Telegraph on Xavi at the 2010 World Cup.[83]
  During the round of 16 match against Portugal, Xavi provided a backheel pass in the 63rd minute to David Villa. Although Villa had his shot with his left foot blocked by goalkeeper Eduardo, he then put in the rebound with his right foot for the winning goal.[84] In the semi-final against Germany, Xavi crossed from a corner to the edge of the six-yard box, where Carles Puyol scored with a header into the top-right corner.[85] Spain dominated possession throughout the competition, averaging 59% possession during their three group matches, and 44 passes per shot throughout the entire World Cup, in large part thanks to midfield trio of Xavi, Iniesta, and Xabi Alonso, who were singled out in the media for their role in Spain's title–run; Spain also completed more passes (3,547) than any World Cup team since 1966.[75][86]
  
  UEFA Euro 2012

  Xavi played for Spain at Euro 2012 which Spain won by defeating Italy 4–0 in the final. Xavi attempted 136 passes (127 completed, 94% success rate) during Spain's 4–0 victory in the group stage match against the Republic of Ireland, more than any other player in a European Championship match. The previous record of 117 had been set by Ronald Koeman in a Euro 1992 match between the Netherlands and Denmark. Xavi and Andrés Iniesta made 229 passes in the match, more than the combined Irish team managed. "Pum, pum, pum, pum" was how Xavi described the rhythmic sound of the ball moving between himself and his midfield partner.[87]
  
  With Xavi providing two assists in the final, for Jordi Alba and Fernando Torres, he became the first player to register assists in two European Championship finals.[12] Spain's UEFA Euro 2012 victory made Xavi the most decorated player in Spanish football history, a status that he previously shared with Carles Puyol, who missed the tournament.[12]
  
  Retirement
  On 5 August 2014, following the 2014 World Cup where Spain were eliminated at the group stage, Xavi announced his retirement from international football, having made 133 appearances in a 14-year period.[88][89] Spain's World Cup-winning manager Vicente del Bosque paid tribute, stating that Xavi was "a key part of the team's style of play" and "he was more important to us than even the manager", also adding, "We will miss him both on and off the pitch. He is a player who we hold in great esteem both personally and as a player. He is and always will be a person and a player who is greatly valued by the federation, the coaching staff and by myself."[90]
  
  Managerial career
  Al Sadd

  On 28 May 2019 it was announced that Xavi would take over as manager of Al Sadd on a two-year contract.[91][92] Xavi helped the club reach the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League, where they were eliminated by Al-Hilal FC 6–5 on aggregate.[93] In the league, the club finished third. In the 2019–20 season, Xavi led his team to win one domestic trophy, the Qatar Cup. In the 2020 AFC Champions League, Al Sadd reached the round of 16 but were eliminated 1–0 by Persepolis.[94][71] During his 97 games in charge of Al Sadd, spanning two and a half years, he led the club to seven trophies.[95]
  
  On 3 November 2021, Al Sadd drew 3–3 against Al-Duhail in his final game in-charge. Two days later Al Sadd announced Xavi's move to Barcelona after his release clause was paid.[96]

  On 6 November 2021, Xavi returned to his former club Barcelona as the new manager replacing Ronald Koeman, on a contract until June 2024.[97] Following his arrival, Xavi reportedly implemented stricter rules for the players which included re-introduction of fines, early arrival for training and tracking of players' off pitch activities.[98][99][100]
  
  In his first game in charge, Barcelona defeated local rival Espanyol by a 1–0 scoreline at the Camp Nou in La Liga to win his first Catalan Derby as manager.[101] On 4 December, Xavi suffered his first defeat as Barcelona manager after losing 1–0 to Real Betis at home in La Liga.[102] In Xavi's first Champions League campaign, he took charge with two group stage matches remaining. After drawing 0–0 with Benfica at the Camp Nou on 23 November and losing 3–0 to Bayern Munich on 8 December at the Allianz Arena, Barcelona finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs.[103][104]
  
  On 12 January 2022, in his first Clásico in charge, Barcelona were beaten by Real Madrid 2–3 at the end of extra-time in the Supercopa de España semi-final.[105] Barcelona suffered an early exit from the Copa del Rey after being beaten by Athletic Bilbao 3–2 at the end of extra-time in the round of 16.[106] In the winter transfer window, Barcelona strengthened their attack with the signings of Ferran Torres and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Adama Traoré on loan. After a difficult first few months for Xavi, Barcelona quickly turned around their form with the new signings playing a big role in the process. The team entered a 14-match unbeaten streak starting with a 0–1 victory over Alavés in La Liga, during this run they scored four goals in 6 out of 11 matches and also qualified for the quarter-finals of the Europa League. On 20 March, Xavi won his first Clásico as manager beating Real Madrid 0–4 in La Liga at the Santiago Bernabéu ending their five-match Clásico losing streak and extending their unbeaten run to 12 matches.[107][108] On April 14, Xavi and his men who were on the verge of a monumental comeback, were knocked out of the UEL quarter-finals by Eintracht Frankfurt, bringing their fifteen-game unbeaten run to an end.[109] In La Liga, he led Barcelona to a second-placed finish from ninth position when he took charge.[110][111]
  
  Style of play
  
  Xavi would often evade players with a 360 degree turn (la pelopina), before finding a teammate with a pinpoint pass
  Xavi is widely considered one of the best midfielders of all time,[5][6][112][113] relying largely on his ability to find and exploit space as a deep-lying playmaker. As he said, "That's what I do: look for spaces. All day. I'm always looking."[114][115] Finding space, he would appear for a teammate to receive and then move the ball on, with his coach Pep Guardiola putting it: "I get the ball, I give the ball, I get the ball, I give the ball."[116] A diminutive, composed, agile, and technically skilled player with a slender physique and a low centre of gravity, these characteristics compensated for his lack of pace or physicality.[83][86][117] Xavi's signature move when in possession involved him performing a 360 degree turn, a feint known as la pelopina, that allowed him to move away from the opposing player, retain possession, and gave him space and time on the ball to think about his next pass.[118] In his youth, he had also played as a centre-back, before being shifted to a midfield role.[86] While primarily a central midfielder with Barcelona,[119] he often played in a more advanced midfield role with Spain.[120]
  
  "I think I haven't changed at all to what I am now. I've been a passer since a young age. I liked passing with the rest of the players and my friends when we played football on the streets, in the main square, and at school. I think I was very similar to what people see in the stadium."
  
  Xavi on his own style of play, November 2014.[22]
  Although he was not known for his tackling ability, or for being prolific in front of goal,[83] Xavi's outstanding vision, "metronomic" pinpoint accurate passing,[121] excellent off the ball movement, superb reading of the game, positional sense, and world-class ball control allowed him to create chances for teammates and dictate the flow of play in midfield, while rarely relinquishing possession.[122][123] These qualities were displayed by his performance during Spain's 2010 World Cup victory, where he maintained a 91% passing success rate throughout the entire tournament, in addition to providing two assists, while Spain dominated possession throughout the competition.[124][125][126][127]
  
  Xavi's ability to control games earned him the sobriquet, The Puppet Master.[121][128] Jorge Valdano opined, "If football was a science, Xavi would have discovered the formula. With a ball at his feet, no one else has ever communicated so intelligently with every player on the pitch."[95] Barcelona president Sandro Rosell believed that Xavi, together with Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Sergio Busquets, perfected the club's tiki-taka style of play, a style introduced to the club by former coach Johan Cruyff.[129] Despite primarily being a creative player, however, he was also capable of scoring goals himself in addition to assisting them.[32] Named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI, Xavi's creativity, range of passing, and unique set of skills have led many in the sport to regard him as one of the greatest passers[130] and one of the finest playmakers in history.[116][131] In addition to his playing ability, Xavi was also praised for his leadership.[132][133]
  
  Media
  Xavi has a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas and has appeared in Adidas commercials alongside Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Robin van Persie.[134] Xavi has worn Adidas Predator boots.[135]
  
  In November 2014, Xavi appeared in FIFA's "11 against Ebola" campaign with a selection of top football players from around the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Gareth Bale and Didier Drogba.[136] Under the slogan "Together, we can beat Ebola", FIFA's campaign was done in conjunction with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and health experts, with the players holding up 11 messages to raise awareness of the disease and ways to combat it.[136][137]
  
  Personal life
  Since July 2013, Xavi has been married to Nuria Cunillera. They have a daughter, Asia, born in 2016 and a son, Dan, born in 2018.[138][139]
